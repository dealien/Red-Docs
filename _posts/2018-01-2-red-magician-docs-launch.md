Over the past month or so, Red Magician has reached a point in its development where in order to provide proper documentation, I need to actually provide my own documentation instead of relying on that of Twentysix26's original Red DiscordBot. So naturally I decided to copy their entire documentation and then rewrite everything that no longer applies to the current state of Red Magician. There are also many things which I feel could be made more clear/intuitive, so I'll be rewriting those as well. 

I'm looking forward to this new endeavor, and seeing as I've never actually successfully used Jekyll, GitHub pages, or anything else really before, this should be fun!
